excerpt: 'The  study  to  investigate  the  effect  of  online  song  psychotherapy  on  stress,  self-efficacy,  and  career maturity  of  job  seekers.  A  total  of  18  job  seekers  participated  in  the  study(9  for  online  song psychotherapy  group,  9  for  music  listening  group).  The  online  music  therapy  program  consisted  of pre-  and  post-  evaluation  session  and  8  therapy  sessions(50-minute  session,  twice  per  week). Job-seeking  stress,  self-efficacy,  career  maturity,  and  non-parametic  verification  were  administered  for both  groups.  The  results  showed  that  the  experimental  group  showed  statistically  significant improvements  in  Job-seeking  stress(p  <.05),  self-efficacy(p  <.01),  and  career  maturity(p  <.05), compared  to  the  control  group.  In  addition,  that  pre-post  difference  of  career  maturity  in  the experimental  group  increased  significantly  as  compared  with  those  in  the  control  group.  The  findings together  indicated  that  online  song  psychotherapy.  helps  reduce  Job-seeking  stress  and  improves self-efficacy  and  career  maturity  for  job-seekers.'
