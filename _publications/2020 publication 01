excerpt: 'Musical cueing has been widely utilised in post-stroke motor rehabilitation; however, the kinematic evidence on the effects of musical cueing is sparse. Further, the element-specific effects of musical cueing on upper-limb movements have rarely been investigated. This study aimed to kinematically quantify the effects of no auditory, rhythmic auditory, and melodic auditory cueing on shoulder abduction, holding, and adduction in patients who had experienced hemiparetic stroke. Kinematic data were obtained using inertial measurement units embedded in wearable bands. During the holding phase, melodic auditory cueing significantly increased the minimum Euler angle and decreased the range of motion compared with the other types of cueing. Further, the root mean square error in the angle measurements was significantly smaller and the duration of movement execution was significantly shorter during the holding phase when melodic auditory cueing was provided than when the other types of cueing were used. These findings indicated the important role of melodic auditory cueing for enhancing movement positioning, variability, and endurance. This study provides the first kinematic evidence on the effects of melodic auditory cueing on kinematic enhancement, thus suggesting the potential use of pitch-related elements in psychomotor rehabilitation.'
