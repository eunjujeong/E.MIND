excerpt: 'The purpose of the study is to review the usage of auditory stimuli in digitalized cognitive rehabilitation for acquired brain injury (ABI). For this, we searched the literature from the past 10 years using keywords including ‘ABI’, ‘digital’, ‘auditory’, and ‘cognitive rehabilitation,’ and identified 9 relevant articles. The analysis framework covered general characteristics of the literature, characteristics of auditory stimuli, digital technology, outcome measurement, and the functions of auditory stimuli and digital technology. Our findings revealed that most participants were patients with stroke and that the outcome measurements mostly evaluated attention and working memory. Auditory stimuli were mainly utilized through auditory feedback, while digital technology was frequently employed via computers and virtual reality. The core functions of auditory stimuli were found to enhance neurotransmitter activity and to provide immediate feedback for the users’ response, whereas digital technology primarily enhanced motivation and engagement. Our study can provide foundational information on the use of auditory stimuli in digitalized cognitive rehabilitation for ABI.'
