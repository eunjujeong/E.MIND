excerpt: 'Upper extremity dysfunction is a common consequence following stroke. Spontaneous recovery during the first six months post-stroke is rigorous and considered as a significant indicator of potential long-term progress. Various approaches have been utilized to regain functional upper limb movement necessary for independent living; however, conventional therapy approaches have failed to prove consistency, especially for subacute stroke patients. There is, thus, a need for innovative therapeutic strategies that motivate stroke survivors to facilitate neural and functional recovery during the critical window immediately following stroke. The effect of music on physical enhancement has been frequently reported in the field of medicine as well as neurorehabilitation. The efficacy of rhythm on lower extremity deficits has been well established. Yet, the rationale for using instrumental music making enhancing subacute upper extremities rehabilitation is not clearly described to date. Based on the key mechanism of music as sensori-motor movement facilitator, this paper reviews previous empirical research that utilized music-based interventions for upper extremity rehabilitation for stroke patients, either in the form of receptive or expressive activity. This paper, further, focuses on the current research trends in subacute stroke upper limb rehabilitation and provides applicable rationale of using instrumental music playing.'
