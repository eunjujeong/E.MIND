E-MIND (Ewha Music Intelligence Neuroscience Design Lab)는 음악의 치료적 원리 및 실제를 토대로 한 기초 및 응용연구를 수행하며, 음악의 치료적 효능과 기술의 융합을 통해 Everywhere, Everyone, Everytime 음악치료 서비스를 위한 대면 및 비대면 콘텐츠, 시스템 알고리듬 등의 결과물을 도출 및 보급을 목적으로 합니다. 현재, 정부 및 지방자치단체, 공공연구기관, 대기업 및 중소기업과의 협력을 바탕으로 미래 모빌리티 디지털 헬스케어 시스템 개발, 쾌적한 음환경 조성을 위한 스마트 사운드스케이프 시스템 개발, 뇌졸중, 파킨슨, 경도인지장애 환자의 운동 및 인지 재활을 위한 디지털 치료제 개발 및 검증 연구를 수행하고 있습니다.

Our mission is to develop and disseminate evidence-based music therapy services through the convergence of therapeutic music principles and advanced technologies, making music therapy accessible Everywhere, Everyone, Everytime.

Research Philosophy
======
E-MIND Lab conducts fundamental and applied research based on therapeutic principles and practices of music. Our interdisciplinary approach combines neuroscience, music therapy, digital healthcare, and advanced technologies to create innovative solutions for cognitive rehabilitation, wellness enhancement, and therapeutic intervention.

Current Research Areas
======
Our laboratory focuses on three primary research domains that leverage the therapeutic potential of music through technological innovation:

**Future Mobility Digital Healthcare Systems**
We develop comprehensive digital healthcare solutions for automotive environments, including sleep therapy systems, emotional care solutions, and multisensory technologies that enhance well-being during transportation.

**Smart Soundscape Systems**
Our team creates intelligent acoustic environments that promote wellness and stress reduction through personalized soundscape interventions, noise mitigation technologies, and adaptive audio systems for various living and working spaces.

**Digital Therapeutics for Neurological Rehabilitation** 
We design and validate digital therapeutic interventions for patients with stroke, Parkinson's disease, and mild cognitive impairment, utilizing virtual reality, brain-computer interfaces, and music-based cognitive training systems.

Collaborative Research Network
======
E-MIND Lab maintains active collaborations with government agencies, local governments, public research institutions, and both large and small enterprises. These partnerships enable us to translate our research findings into practical applications and ensure that our innovations reach those who need them most.

Our collaborative approach allows us to:
- Conduct large-scale clinical trials and validation studies
- Develop commercially viable therapeutic products
- Create evidence-based intervention protocols
- Establish standardized assessment tools for clinical practice

Technology Integration
======
We leverage cutting-edge technologies to advance music therapy research and applications:

- **Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI)** for decoding musical imagination and intention
- **Virtual and Augmented Reality** for immersive therapeutic experiences
- **Artificial Intelligence** for personalized intervention design
- **Biosignal Processing** for real-time physiological monitoring
- **Mobile Health Technologies** for accessible intervention delivery
