E-MIND Lab conducts cutting-edge research across multiple domains, developing innovative solutions that bridge music therapy, neuroscience, and digital healthcare technologies. Our projects span from fundamental research to applied clinical interventions, all aimed at improving human health and well-being through music-based therapeutic approaches.

Current Projects
======

**Arts-integrated Digital Sleeponomics for Insomnia**
**불면증 극복을 위한 예술 융합형 디지털 슬리포노믹스**
- **Funding Agency**: National Research Foundation of Korea (한국연구재단)
- **Period**: 2025.6 ~ 2028.5

Our research team focuses on utilizing music as a core medium for overcoming insomnia, paying attention to the therapeutic value of music as a psychological and emotional intervention that encompasses both universality and individuality, as well as the effect of inducing physiological responses based on music-biosignal synchronization. Through this research, we plan to develop a digital sleeponomics service prototype that enables psychological and emotional care before and after sleep for insomnia patients and real-time adaptive intervention during sleep. This research is expected to derive personalized insomnia solutions and expand to digital wellness and digital therapeutics (DTx) fields, contributing to improving national sleep health.


**Development of Personalized Noise Mitigation Technology and Service Based on Noise Simulation**
**개인공간 소음 문제 해결을 위한 소음 시뮬레이션기반 개인 맞춤형 소음 완화 기술 및 서비스 개발**
- **Funding Agency**: Korea Evaluation Institute of Industrial Technology (한국산업기술기획평가원)
- **Period**: 2023.4 ~ 2025.12

This project aims to develop a sound masking scape system for noise stress mitigation in personal spaces encompassing both residential and work environments. To achieve this, we perform user noise sensitivity and stress multidimensional evaluation for typification, develop ambiance sound sources for noise masking, and create soundscape sources that meet the usage purposes specific to spatial characteristics. Based on this, we will ultimately develop a personalized noise management service and verify the effectiveness of noise stress reduction.
