Completed Projects
======
**Development and Validation of Multisensory Sleep Solution in Vehicle**
**멀티센서리 기술을 활용한 차량 환경에서의 숙면 테라피 솔루션 개발**
- **Funding Agency**: Hyundai Motors (현대자동차)
- **Period**: 2023.9 ~ 2024.8

The advancement of autonomous vehicle technology provides new opportunities for various activities within vehicles. Despite these technological advances, efficient sleep induction in vehicles remains a technical challenge. Existing sleep technologies, such as noise blocking, music playback, and lighting control, provide basic rest support functions, but have limitations in maximizing sleep quality in vehicles during long-distance travel or heavy traffic periods.

The purpose of this research is to develop sleep induction technology utilizing music-based emotional vibration in vehicles, based on scientific evidence that auditory and tactile stimulation can improve sleep quality. Additionally, we aim to verify the effects of music and vibration content provided in vehicles on subjective sleep experience and biosignal responses.

The music-based content and technology developed through this research will optimize the in-vehicle sleep environment, allowing users to experience effective and high-quality sleep even during long-distance travel or traffic congestion. Furthermore, it can be utilized as an innovative digital healthcare solution that can enhance rest and sleep in various environments.

**Development and Validation of Immersive Music-based Neurocognitive Training for Mild Cognitive Impairments**
**경도인지장애를 위한 가상현실 기반 음악-신경 인지재활 콘텐츠 개발 및 임상효과 검증**
- **Funding Agency**: Ewha Womans University New Faculty Support Program (이화여대 신임교원지원사업)
- **Period**: 2023.3 ~ 2025.2

Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is an important intermediate stage that may progress to Alzheimer's disease, making early screening and intervention crucial. Recent research has shown that virtual reality-based music training is effective in enhancing cognitive and motor functions, but there is currently a lack of systematic music-based training protocols that match MCI subtypes.

Therefore, the purpose of this research is to develop and validate the effects of a music-based neural cognitive rehabilitation program using virtual reality for MCI patients. Virtual reality has the advantage of enabling MCI patients to perform home-based rehabilitation training, making it more accessible and widespread than existing rehabilitation methods. This represents an innovative approach that can complement or replace existing rehabilitation methods, improving the quality of life for mild cognitive impairment patients and contributing to long-term health maintenance.

**Development of Soundscape Contents for Everywhere, Everyone and Every Moment**
**사용자 환경, 개인 성향별 음원 구축을 위한 사운드 스케이프 음악 컨텐츠 개발**
- **Funding Agency**: Hyundai Motors (현대자동차)
- **Period**: 2022.9 ~ 2023.8

As the demand for seamless soundscape UX that can enhance experiences in daily spaces such as vehicles, residential spaces, and offices increases, the necessity for platform development, operating system construction, and content development to provide effective auditory experiences has been raised. Therefore, this project aims to develop soundscape contents customized for user environment, purpose, and individual disposition by analyzing and deriving soundscape factors and indexes according to various environments and user dispositions.

**Listening to the Body Rhythm: Vibroacoustic Rhythm for Interoceptive and Exteroceptive Integration in Autism Spectrum Disorder**
**자폐 범주성 장애의 내수용/외수용 감각 신경 매커니즘 규명 및 통합 촉진을 위한 BCI 기반 진동음향 리듬 콘텐츠 개발**
- **Funding Agency**: National Research Foundation of Korea Basic Research Program (한국연구재단 이공분야기초연구사업)
- **Period**: 2020.6 ~ 2023.2

Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) experience difficulties in integrating external sensory information and self-recognition, showing deficits in recognizing the presence of others and interacting with them. This project aims to develop BCI-based vibroacoustic rhythm content that can promote integration between interoceptive and exteroceptive senses by utilizing the fact that synchronization between intrinsically periodic internal autonomic nervous responses and external environmental stimuli affects body and self-recognition. Through this, we aim to present new solutions for early social-cognitive diagnosis and rehabilitation of ASD.

**Decoding Inner Music Using Electrocorticography**
**뇌신호 해독을 통한 BCI-Musicing시스템 개발**
- **Funding Agency**: Samsung Electronics (삼성전자)
- **Period**: 2019.12 ~ 2023.5

This project aims to address the lack of opportunities for expressive artistic activities and rehabilitation training faced by patients with severe brain lesions, and to develop alternative interfaces that can promote voluntary participation in artistic sensation and expression through their intact functions.

The "Musicing BCI" system detects and decodes inner music sounds from brain signals and implements them as music, proposing a new system that can be utilized as part of artistic expression participation and rehabilitation training for patients with severe brain lesions.
